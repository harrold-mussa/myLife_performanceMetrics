# My Life's Performance Metrics

## Continuous Project
This repository is a fun project for me to use my data engineering skills to track my life metrics which include the following down below:

| Health | Finance | Happiness | Goals Achieved | Memories Made | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

### For Health
The idea is the Health column will be divded into two sub-columns:
1. Weight Loss and Tracking
2. Caloric intake Tracking

Data visualization with matplotlib will be made to identify the trend of my weight and caloric intake throughout my life. 

### For Finance
The goal for the Finance column is to divded into three sub-columns:
1. Money saved
2. Money spent
3. Money invested

The idea is to see if there is a trend in an increase in savings, invested, and spent. 

### For Happiness
This metric is quite hard to track, especially with real fluctuations of mood during the day. But the metric will be quantified by the overall mood of the day, pointed at the end of the day. 

Happiness is tracked daily and the idea is to see the trend in happiness or if there are days where the happiness score decreases. 

### Goals Achieved
This column will be broken down into four sub-columns:
1. Self-improvement goals
2. Financial goals
3. Work-related goals
4. Family goals

No graphing will be made to track the goals as each goal is done once and left. 

### Memories Made
This column will not be broken down. In fact, each day will be recorded if a great experience has been made that is considered to be memorable, and if not, the record will be null.
