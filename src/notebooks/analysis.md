## Comparison Analysis.ipynb versus Testing Analysis.ipynb

My **testing_analysis.ipynb** notebook is a testing playground to identify if the notebook was able to retrieve the data from the Docker PostgreSQL database image. Indeed, it was able to pull the data (yay). The **comparison_analysis.ipynb** is the next notebook to identify comparison of different habit trackers. For the moment, what has been recorded and visualized is the water intake versus health metric registered per day.
