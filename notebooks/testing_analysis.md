#Goal of testing_analysis Jupyter Notebook

This notebook is to identify and see if I am able to pull the data from the Docker Image [Postgres:15-alpine]. The idea is to create simple queries to pull data from the Fact Table and the Dimensions table.

Once there is enough information on every table, at least a month's work, I will then be able to visualize and plot the data but also apply aggregate functions to see the comparisons of each table on a graph.
